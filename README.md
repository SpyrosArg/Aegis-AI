Building Your Own AI Security Agent
A few months ago, I started building an autonomous AI agent that could think and act like a security expert. Today, I'm sharing the complete journey, the architecture decisions, security considerations and lessons learned.

Why Build Your Own AI Security Agent?
As a Cyber Security Engineer, I saw a gap where traditional tools couldn't handle domain-specific threats fast enough. I started building an autonomous AI agent that could think and act like a security expert. Today, I'm sharing the complete journey - the architecture decisions, security considerations and lessons learned.

Core Questions:
•	What decisions will it make autonomously?
•	What's the cost of being wrong?
•	How fast must it respond?
•	What domain expertise does it need?

Security Questions:
•	What's the blast radius of a compromise?
•	How do we prevent adversarial use?
•	What are the compliance requirements?
•	How do we maintain audit trails?

Step 1: Choose Your Architecture (With Security in Mind)
