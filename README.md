**Building Your Own AI Security Agent**

Aegis is an autonomous AI security agent, specifically, a fine-tuned LLM integrated with real-time threat intelligence that makes security decisions within milliseconds. It combines a domain-specialized language model with a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline, wrapped in a secure orchestration layer that enables autonomous threat detection and response. Think of it as a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst that never sleeps, powered by AI.

**Why Build Your Own AI Security Agent?**

As a Cyber Security Engineer, I saw a gap where traditional tools couldn't handle domain-specific threats fast enough. Generic security solutions miss context, they don't understand your specific industry's protocols, constraints or threat landscape. This guide walks you through building a specialized AI agent that does.

Core Questions:
- What decisions will it make autonomously?
- What's the cost of being wrong?
- How fast must it respond?
- What domain expertise does it need?

Security Questions:
- What's the blast radius of a compromise?
- How do we prevent adversarial use?
- What are the compliance requirements?
- How do we maintain audit trails?
